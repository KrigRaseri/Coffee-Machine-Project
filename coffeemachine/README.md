A simple coffee machine program with a menu, and some basic options.

Buy: To buy your choice of coffee.

Fill: To fill up the ingredients in the coffee machine.

Take: Takes the money out of the machine.

Remaining: Prints the remaining ingredients in the coffee machine.

Currents only supports 3 coffee options.

3. Cappuccino

But could easily support more.
